## Go for Light Table

An unofficial Go language plugin for Light Table.

I'm not a Clojure expert so don't expect too much fanciness here, changes are welcome.

### Features

1. `go fmt` integration, via command, working on fmt after each save.
2. Dummy eval `Ctrl+Enter` (check client/echo_server.go) instead of code evaluation. Needs integration with MarGo (like [GoSublime](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime)).
